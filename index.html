<ul>
<li>Git is version control system (VCS).</li>
<li>Design to handle everithing from small to large projects.</li>
<li>Git is one of from VCS there is another tools available like Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="version-control">Version control?</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is software that track and manage changes to files over time.</li>
<li>Version control allow user to revisit earlier versions of the files, compare changes between versions, undo changes and whole lot more.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="git-help-us-to">Git help us to</h3>
<ul>
<li>Track changes across multiple files.</li>
<li>Compare versions of project.</li>
<li>“Time Travel” back to old version.</li>
<li>Revert to previous version.</li>
<li>Collaborate and share changes.</li>
<li>Combine changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="git-vs-github">Git vs GitHub</h2>
<h3 id="git">Git</h3>
<p>Git is version control software that runs locally on your machine. you don’t need to register for an account.<br>
You don’t need the internet to use it.</p>
<h3 id="github">Github</h3>
<p>It is service that host git repositories in cloud and make it easier to collaborate with other people.<br>
You need to sign up to use github. It is online place where you can share your work.</p>
<h2 id="git-config-username--email">Git config username &amp; email</h2>
<p><code>git config --global user.name "&lt;name&gt;"</code><br>
<code>git config --global user.email &lt;email&gt;</code></p>
<h2 id="git-kraken">Git Kraken</h2>
<p>GUI for git user</p>
<h2 id="repository-repo">Repository (Repo)</h2>
<p><code>git-init</code> - Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one</p>
<p>A Git “Repo” is a workspace which tracks and manages files within a folder.<br>
Anytime we want to use Git with a project, app, etc we need to create a new git repository. We can have as many repos on our machine as needed, all with separate histories and contents</p>
<h2 id="git-init">Git init</h2>
<p>Use git init to create a new git repository. Before we can do anything git-related, we must initialize a repo first!<br>
This is something you do once per project.  Initialize the repo in the top-level folder containing your project</p>
<p>for creating git repository.<br>
<code>git init</code></p>
<h3 id="git-folder">.git folder</h3>
<p>When we init git in folder it create <code>.git</code> folder to store all files about git</p>
<h3 id="note"><code>Note</code></h3>
<p>If you do end up making a repo inside of a repo, you can delete it and try again!<br>
To delete a repo, locate the associated .git directory and delete it.<br>
<code>rmdir</code> - Remove Empty Directory<br>
<code>rm -d &lt;dir&gt;</code>  - Remove directory with sub.</p>
<h2 id="git-status">Git Status</h2>
<p>Git status gives information on the current status of a git repository and its contents<br>
It’s very useful, but at the moment we don’t actually have any repos to check the status of!</p>
<h2 id="git-workflow">Git Workflow</h2>
<p><strong><code>Working Dir</code> ----&gt; <code>Staging Area</code> ----&gt; <code>Repository</code></strong></p>
<h2 id="staging-git">Staging git</h2>
<h3 id="git-add">git add</h3>
<p>We use the git add command to stage changes to be committed.<br>
It’s a way of telling Git, “please include this change in our next commit”</p>
<p>Use git add to add specific files to the staging area.  Separate files with spaces to add multiple at once.</p>
<p><code>git add &lt;fileName/folderName/&gt;</code><br>
<strong>Trump Card</strong> --&gt; <code>git add .</code></p>
<h2 id="commit">Commit</h2>
<p>Making a commit is similar to making a save in a video game.  We’re taking a snapshot of a git repository in time.<br>
When saving a file, we are saving the state of a single file.  With Git, we can save the state of multiple files and folders together.<br>
We use the git commit command to actually commit changes from the staging area.<br>
When making a commit, we need to provide a commit message that summarizes the changes and work snapshotted in the commit.<br>
Every commit has some hash to Identify it.<br>
Running <code>git commit</code> will commit all staged changes.  It also opens up a text editor and prompts you for a commit message.<br>
This can be overwhelming when you’re starting out, so instead you can use…<br>
The -m flag allows us to pass in an inline commit message, rather than launching a text editor.</p>
<p><code>git commit -m &lt;msg&gt;'</code><br>
<code>git commit</code></p>
<h2 id="git-log">Git log</h2>
<p>Show commit logs<br>
<code>git log</code><br>
<code>git log --oneline</code> - To show commit msg in one line.</p>
<h2 id="git-ignore-file">Git Ignore File</h2>
<p>We can tell Git which files and directories to ignore in a given repository, using a <code>.gitignore</code>file.<br>
This is useful for files you know you NEVER want to commit, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secrets, API keys, credentials, etc.</li>
<li>Operating System files (.DS_Store on Mac)</li>
<li>Log files</li>
<li>Dependencies &amp; packages</li>
</ul>
<p>Create a file called <code>.gitignore</code> in the root of a repository.  Inside the file, we can write patterns to tell Git which files &amp; folders to ignore.<br>
<strong>Ref</strong> - <a href="https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore">Gitignore.io</a></p>
<h2 id="commit-message">Commit Message</h2>
<ul>
<li>Commit early and often</li>
<li>Make commits atomic (group similar changes together, don’t commit a million things at once)</li>
<li>Write meaningful but concise commit messages.</li>
<li>Present-Tense, Imperative Style</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="atomic-commits">Atomic commits</h2>
<p>When possible, a commit should encompass a single feature, change, or fix.  In other words, try to keep each commit focused on a single thing.<br>
This makes it much easier to undo or rollback changes later on.  It also makes your code or project easier to review.</p>
<h2 id="change-commit-editor">Change Commit Editor</h2>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C:-Git-Commands-Setup-and-Config">Git Docs</a><br>
<strong>VSCode</strong><br>
<code>git config --global core.editor "code --wait"</code></p>
<h2 id="amending-commits">Amending Commits</h2>
<p>Suppose you just made a commit and then realized you forgot to include a file! Or, maybe you made a typo in the commit message that you want to correct.<br>
Rather than making a brand new separate commit, you can “redo” the previous commit using the --amend option.</p>
<p><strong>eg.</strong></p>
<pre class=" language-git"><code class="prism  language-git">git commit -m <span class="token string">'some commit'</span>
git add forgotten_file
git commit --amend
</code></pre>
<h2 id="branches">Branches</h2>
<p>Branches are an essential part of Git!<br>
Think of branches as alternative timelines for a project.<br>
They enable us to create separate contexts where we can try new things, or even work on multiple ideas in parallel.<br>
If we make changes on one branch, they do not impact the other branches (unless we merge the changes).<br>

<h2 id="master-branch">Master Branch</h2>
<p>In git, we are always working on a branch* The default branch name is master.<br>
Many people designate the master branch as their “source of truth” or the “official branch” for their codebase, but that is left to you to decide.<br>
From Git’s perspective, the master branch is just like any other branch.  It does not have to hold the “master copy” of your project.</p>
<p>Use git branch to view your existing branches. The default branch in every git repo is master, though you can configure this.<br>
Look for the * which indicates the branch you are currently on.<br>
<code>git branch</code></p>
<p>Use git branch  to make a new branch based upon the current HEAD This just creates the branch.  It does not switch you to that branch (the HEAD stays the same)<br>
<code>git branch &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></p>
<p>Once you have created a new branch, use git switch  to switch to it.<br>
<code>git switch &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></p>
<h2 id="master-vs-main">Master vs Main</h2>
<p>In 2020, Github renamed the default branch from master to main. The default Git branch name is still master, though the Git team is exploring a potential change.</p>
<h2 id="head">HEAD</h2>
<p>We’ll often come across the term HEAD in Git.<br>
HEAD is simply a pointer that refers to the current “location” in your repository.  It points to a particular branch reference.<br>
So far, HEAD always points to the latest commit you made on the master branch, but soon we’ll see that we can move around and HEAD will change!<br>
HEAD is Refer to Branch</p>
<h2 id="branch-switch">Branch Switch</h2>
<p>Once you have created a new branch, use git switch  to switch to it.<br>
<code>git switch &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></p>
<p>Historically, we used git checkout  to switch branches.  This still works.<br>
The checkout command does a million additional things, so the decision was made to add a standalone switch command which is much simpler.<br>
You will see older tutorials and docs using checkout rather than switch.  Both now work.<br>
<code>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></p>
<p>Use git switch with the -c flag to create a new branch AND switch to it all in one go.<br>
Remember -c as short for “create”<br>
<code>git switch -c &lt;branch-name&gt;</code></p>
<h2 id="branch-info">Branch Info</h2>
<p>Use the -v flag with git branch to view more information about each branch.<br>
<code>git branch -v</code></p>
